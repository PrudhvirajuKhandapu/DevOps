# Jenkins Preparation Guide

This repository is a structured guide to help you learn **Jenkins** for DevOps, covering everything from basics to advanced topics.  
Itâ€™s useful for **beginners, interview preparation, and real-time CI/CD practice**.

---

##  What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an **open-source automation server** used to build, test, and deploy applications.  
It enables **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)**, integrating with tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform.

---

##  Prerequisites
Before starting with Jenkins, you should know:
- Basic **Linux commands**
- **Git** (clone, push, branches)
- **Java** (Jenkins runs on Java)
- DevOps concepts (CI/CD, automation)

---

##  Learning Path

### 1. Getting Started
- Introduction to Jenkins & its architecture (Master/Agent)  
- Install Jenkins (Linux, Docker, or Cloud)  
- Manage plugins & initial setup  

### 2. Jenkins Jobs
- Create **Freestyle jobs**  
- Parameterized jobs  
- Build triggers: SCM polling, webhooks, cron  

### 3. Pipelines
- What is a Pipeline? (Declarative vs Scripted)  
- Writing a `Jenkinsfile`  
- Stages, steps, agents, post-actions  
- Shared libraries for reusability  

### 4. Integrations
- GitHub/GitLab integration  
- Maven/Gradle build tools  
- Docker build & push  
- Kubernetes deployments  
- Terraform/Ansible automation  

### 5. Administration
- Manage users, roles, and security  
- Configure global tools (JDK, Maven, Docker)  
- Setup Jenkins agents/nodes  
- Backup & restore  

---

##  Practice Scenarios
- Clone a Git repo and build it with Jenkins  
- Automate unit tests & artifact archiving  
- Build & push Docker images  
- Deploy an app to Kubernetes with a Jenkins pipeline  

---

##  Interview Tips
Be ready to answer:
- Difference between Freestyle and Pipeline jobs  
- Jenkins architecture and high availability  
- Security best practices  
- Real-time CI/CD pipeline setup scenarios
